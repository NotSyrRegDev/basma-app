                    During the Hajj season, there are several agencies that serve in the health field, and each agency has its own mechanism to provide service to pilgrims, so we have created a site to facilitate coordination between these agencies in order not to have more than one agency to provide the service in the same case, in order to reduce overcrowding in one case.
